      <h2>About This Page</h2>
      <p>
        This simple demo shows how the CSS box model works with 
        margins, borders, padding, and content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every element on a webpage can be thought of as a rectangular box.
        The spacing, sizing, and alignment you see are controlled through
        the box model.

      <h2>Another Example</h2>
      <p>
        Notice how spacing and layout are controlled with the 
        <strong>margin</strong>, <strong>padding</strong>, and <strong>border</strong> properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Margins add space outside an element, while padding adds space
        inside between the content and the border. This distinction is
        crucial for precise layout design.

      <h2>Image Demo</h2>
      <p>
        Below is an example image from Pexels, styled using the box model
        to demonstrate how margins, padding, and borders can affect even
        media elements:
      </p>
      <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3408744/pexels-photo-3408744.jpeg" 
           alt="Nature Landscape" class="demo-img">
      <p>
        The image above has padding, margin, and a border applied to it
        through CSS. You can clearly see the spacing between the image
        and surrounding elements.
